# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
As a data analyst at a ride-sharing startup named PyBer. Given my technical background, the CEO has asked me to run analysis on our internal 2019 ride data. The goal is to split the data into three categories - Urban, Suburban, and Rural. To run a comparative analysis across these three categories, I studied key variables such as ride fare, driver count, and total number of rides completed.

## Results
Below is a summary dataframe from the analysis:

Our results were as expected. For example, in urban areas we expect to see a higher count of rides in a year than rural. In fact, urban areas had more than 10x the ride volume compared to rural cities. However, the difference in driver counts between urban, suburban, and rural areas was much highe than expected. There are 7x more drivers in urban areas than suburban. The difference is even larger for rural vs urban driver count with there being 110x more drivers in urban areas. Fares are the highest in rural areas, which make sense as there is such limited supply of drivers. However, it would be interesting to look at $/mi. in terms of fare, because people in rural and suburban areas are likely traveling much farther in a PyBer than those in urban areas. To make up for the mileage and resources used such as gas, rural and suburban drivers tend to make more per ride than drivers in urban areas, where driver count is much higher.
